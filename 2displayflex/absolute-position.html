<h1>Absolute Positioning</h1>
   
    <div class="one">
      <p>I stil don't understand this positioning. First of all
        tag div and class one, two, three point out same elements.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="two">
      <p>div position is relative and set to inline-block.
        And to be distiguished background color was set 
        to be purple. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="three">
      <p> class one two three looks like div's children,
        so that positioned as absoulte so that it positioned
      by relative ancesstor. I tired to move class property
    to p tag but it did not work at all. </p>
