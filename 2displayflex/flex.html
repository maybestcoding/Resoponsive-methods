    <h1>Flexbox</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="one">
        <p>This position looks simpler than other
          postioning. It is very clear to make a container
          which is flex box. Do not forget to set the gap 
          between content. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="two">
        <p>Inside flex box there are 3 div tags which are
          block elements, but their original disply values are ignored 
          and they all act like inline elements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="three">
        <p>One thing makes me confused in index.html
          there is no ul tags. However, li tags are worked as unordered lists since
          it is default value so we had to set list-style
          as none to clear the dot. 
          Also if you include ul, you can see layout looks
          totally different. It seems like manly there are
          two tags(p and ul) and inside ul there are li
          elements which are lied vertically not horizontally.
